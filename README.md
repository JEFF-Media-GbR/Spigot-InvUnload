# InvUnload


Automatically puts your stuff into the right chests

You don't have time to open every chest in your storage room to tidy up your inventory?
Fear no more! You have no more excuses for having chests full of random garbage!

InvUnload does two brilliant things: When you enter /unload, it checks if there are chests nearby.

For each chest, the player's inventory will be searched for matching items. If there are any, they will be put into the chest.
